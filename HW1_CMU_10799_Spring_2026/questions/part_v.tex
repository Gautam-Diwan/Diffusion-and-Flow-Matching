Now that you have had a fully immersive experience with DDPM, let's take a step back and reflect on what we have learned so far.

\question{Reflection Questions}{10}

\subq{a}{3} Based on your experience implementing and experimenting with DDPM: What do you think DDPM is bad at? Identify 2-3 limitations you observed or suspect. These could relate to sample quality, training efficiency, sampling speed, controllability, or anything else. Be specific—connect each limitation to something concrete from your experiments or implementation.

\subq{b}{3} For those limitations you identified, how do you think they could be improved? Propose at least 2 concrete ideas. These don't need to be novel—they can be things you've heard about, ideas from papers, or your own speculation. For each idea, briefly explain why you think it might help.
(We're not asking you to implement these—just to think critically about the design space.)
